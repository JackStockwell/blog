## Description

SHOUT. Is a fullstack web application blog which allows users to create accounts, make posts to their timeline and allows other users to comment on their posts. 

Their is increased functionality which allows users to edit and delete their own posts on their profile.

This is my first fullstack solo application using the MVC method to organise my stack. I have gained a large deal of knowledge of the sequelize and express npms and how a RESTful API works with CRUD for mySQL models. 

I used RESTful API and the CRUD method to create handlebars that updated with the infomation provided by the backend to create my webpages and connect them together was a difficult task, relying heavily on the user data stored in the html such as a post ID in order to load the content of that post. Then using JS on the front end to Create, Update and Delete was also challening but it was ultimately accomplished.

I am now much more confident in my ability of the MVC method and the fullstack of a web application and I learned many new things along the way like the use of modals and model relationships.
